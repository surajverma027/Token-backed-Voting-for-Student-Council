# DecentralVote 🗳️

*A Transparent Blockchain-Based Voting System on Aptos*

---

## 📖 Description

DecentralVote is a decentralized voting platform built on the Aptos blockchain that enables transparent, secure, and tamper-proof voting processes. The smart contract allows users to create polls on any topic and enables community members to cast their votes in a trustless environment.

### ✨ Key Features
- **🏗️ Poll Creation**: Create voting polls with custom topics
- **🔒 Secure Voting**: One-person-one-vote mechanism with blockchain verification
- **👁️ Transparency**: All votes are recorded on-chain and publicly verifiable
- **🛡️ Immutability**: Results cannot be manipulated once votes are cast
- **🌐 Decentralization**: No central authority controls the voting process
- **🚫 Double-Vote Prevention**: Smart contract prevents users from voting twice

### 🛠️ Smart Contract Functions
1. **`create_poll(creator, topic)`** - Creates a new voting poll
2. **`cast_vote(voter, poll_owner, vote_yes)`** - Casts a yes/no vote on a poll

## 🎯 Vision

To democratize decision-making processes by providing a transparent, accessible, and secure voting infrastructure that can be used by communities, organizations, and institutions worldwide. 

Our vision is to eliminate traditional voting barriers such as:
- 📍 Geographical limitations
- 🤔 Trust and manipulation concerns  
- 🏛️ Centralized control issues
- 💰 High implementation costs

We envision a future where **every voice matters**, **every vote counts**, and **every decision** is made through transparent consensus mechanisms powered by decentralized technology.
